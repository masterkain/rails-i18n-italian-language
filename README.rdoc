== Ruby on Rails I18n SimpleBackend Italian language files.

This collection of files is meant to add a basic support for Italian language
to your Rails (edge) application.

Files are encoded with UTF-8 and stored with accented vowels directly, leaving
the entities encoding to the views.

Every file is in YAML format.

The main file, which is probably what you want, is *it-IT.yml*.

Hovewer for your convenience I've splitted the content of this file into the
areas they belongs to, like action_view, active_record, active_support.
